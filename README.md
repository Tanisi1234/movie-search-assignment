# Movie Search Assignment

This repository contains my solution for the semantic search on movie plots assignment.  
It demonstrates a semantic search system for movies using sentence embeddings.  
It allows users to search for movies by plot description and returns the most relevant results.

## Files
- **movie_search.py**: Main Python module containing the movie search logic using Sentence Transformers and pandas.  
- **movies.csv**: Sample dataset of movies with titles and plot descriptions.  
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages.  
- **tests/test_movie_search.py**: Unit tests for the search functionality.  
- **solution.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for interactive exploration and demonstration.

## Setup

### Install dependencies
Run the following command in your environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the notebook
Open solution.ipynb in Jupyter and follow the instructions.

### Run tests
Execute the tests to verify functionality:
```
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
```
## Usage
Use the search_movies(query, top_n) function in movie_search.py to find the top N movies most relevant to your query.
The function returns a pandas DataFrame with the movie title, plot, and similarity score.

## Example
```
from movie_search import search_movies
results = search_movies("spy thriller in Paris", top_n=3)
print(results)
